# High Performance Game Programming

This project examines the Entity-Component-System (ECS) programming
paradigm through the development of a simulation project titled Huge Frog
Simulation, created using Unity 3Dâ€™s Data-Oriented Technology Stack (DOTS).
The ECS approach, with its emphasis on data-first logic, proved effective in
managing large numbers of entities within complex scenarios. It addressed
issues like memory fragmentation and ensured smoother rendering processes. 
The project involved designing an environment where entities move ran-
domly, interact through collisions, and progress toward an undefined end-
point.
